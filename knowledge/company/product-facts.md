# RTGS.global Product Facts

## What is RTGS.global?

RTGS.global is a real-time gross settlement network that connects payment service providers, fintechs, and financial institutions for instant cross-border payments without the traditional correspondent banking infrastructure.

### Core Concept
Instead of routing payments through chains of correspondent banks (which adds days and fees), RTGS.global enables direct settlement between network members in seconds.
