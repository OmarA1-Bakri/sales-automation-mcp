## Objection Responses by Value Prop

### "We're already working on licensing"
> "Makes sense - most of our customers started the same way. They typically use RTGS as a fast-track for 2-3 priority markets while licensing continues for others. No need to abandon your licensing work - this accelerates specific corridors."

### "We have good correspondent relationships"
> "That's great - strong banking relationships matter. RTGS works alongside existing relationships for specific corridors where you need faster settlement or better economics. Many customers start with one corridor as a pilot."

### "Real-time settlement isn't a priority"
> "Understood. Out of curiosity, what's your current customer feedback on settlement times? We're seeing that as fintech competition increases, settlement speed is becoming a differentiator. Happy to share what we're seeing in the market."

### "We're focused on cost reduction"
> "Perfect - that's where most conversations start. Beyond the 40-60% cost reduction, customers find the operational efficiency gains are equally valuable. Would it be helpful to see an ROI model based on your volumes?"
