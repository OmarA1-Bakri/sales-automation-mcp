## Understanding Treasury Prospects

### What Does Treasury Do?
Treasury teams manage an organization's cash, liquidity, and financial risk. For PSPs and fintechs, this means managing:
- Pre-funded accounts across multiple currencies/corridors
- Cash positions and forecasting
- FX exposure and hedging
- Working capital optimization
- Banking relationships

### Key Treasury Pain Points

1. **Capital Trapped in Pre-Funding**
   - Multiple correspondent accounts require pre-funding
   - Capital sitting idle in low-yield positions
   - Difficult to forecast exact funding needs
   - Over-funding for safety margin wastes capital

2. **Fragmented Visibility**
   - Multiple bank portals to monitor
   - No unified view of global positions
   - Manual reconciliation across accounts
   - Real-time balance info often unavailable

3. **Operational Complexity**
   - Manual funding decisions
   - Time zone challenges for global operations
   - Weekend/holiday coverage gaps
   - Key person dependencies

4. **FX Management**
   - Exposure across multiple currency pairs
   - Sub-optimal rates from banks
   - Manual FX execution
   - Limited access to competitive rates

5. **Banking Hours Constraints**
   - Can only move money during banking hours
   - Weekend settlements impossible
   - Holiday calendar complexity
   - Funding delays impact operations

## Treasury Personas

### Group Treasurer / VP Treasury
**Primary Pain:** Strategic capital efficiency, board-level reporting
**Decision Driver:** Working capital metrics, ROI
**Key Questions:**
- "What's your current return on pre-funded balances?"
- "How do you report capital efficiency to the board?"
- "What's your target for days of working capital?"

**Approach:** Strategic, metrics-driven, speak to board-level concerns

### Treasury Manager / Treasury Operations
**Primary Pain:** Day-to-day liquidity management, operational efficiency
**Decision Driver:** Operational simplicity, error reduction
**Key Questions:**
- "How much time does your team spend on daily funding decisions?"
- "What happens when your primary treasury person is on leave?"
- "How many bank portals do you monitor daily?"

**Approach:** Operational focus, time savings, reduced manual work

### Cash Manager
**Primary Pain:** Cash positioning, forecasting accuracy
**Decision Driver:** Forecasting accuracy, position optimization
**Key Questions:**
- "How accurate are your cash forecasts?"
- "What's your buffer for unexpected flows?"
- "How do you handle intraday liquidity needs?"

**Approach:** Tactical, focus on daily operations improvement

### FX Manager
**Primary Pain:** FX exposure, rate optimization
**Decision Driver:** Rate competitiveness, exposure management
**Key Questions:**

**Approach:** Rate comparison, exposure reduction, competitive positioning

## Treasury-Specific Messaging

### Opening Hooks

**For Group Treasurer:**
> "Most treasury leaders I speak with have millions tied up in pre-funded correspondent accounts - capital that could be deployed more productively. How is {{company}} thinking about optimizing that capital?"

**For Treasury Manager:**
> "Treasury teams typically spend 2-3 hours daily managing liquidity across multiple bank portals and making funding decisions. Is that similar to what you're seeing at {{company}}?"

**For Cash Manager:**
> "With cross-border volumes growing, most cash managers tell me forecasting has become increasingly difficult - especially across multiple corridors and time zones. How are you handling this at {{company}}?"

**For FX Manager:**
> "Most PSPs we speak with are leaving 20-40 bps on the table with bank FX rates. Have you looked at how {{company}}'s FX costs compare to interbank rates?"

### Value Statements

**Capital Efficiency Focus:**
> "RTGS.global eliminates pre-funding requirements entirely. Instead of parking capital in correspondent accounts, you settle in real-time, just-in-time. For treasury teams, this typically means freeing up 15-25% of working capital while improving settlement speed."

**Operational Efficiency Focus:**
> "One integration, one dashboard, global visibility. No more juggling multiple bank portals or making manual funding decisions. The system handles liquidity automatically, 24/7, even when your team is offline."

**FX Focus:**
> "Access competitive FX rates across our member network - typically 30-50% better than correspondent bank rates. Plus, the instant settlement means less FX exposure from delayed payments."

## Treasury-Specific Objections

### "We've invested in our TMS (Treasury Management System)"
> "A TMS is essential for visibility and control - we integrate with most major platforms. What we add is the execution layer: instant settlement without pre-funding. Think of us as extending your TMS capabilities to real-time cross-border."

### "Our bank gives us good rates"
> "Relationship pricing is valuable. Where we typically add value is: (1) corridors where you don't have strong banking relationships, (2) after-hours or weekend settlements your bank can't do, and (3) new markets where establishing banking takes time."

### "We can't change our treasury processes"
> "No need to overhaul everything. Most customers start with a single corridor pilot alongside existing processes. Once the team sees the operational simplicity, they typically expand. The integration is one API - it doesn't require process redesign."

### "Our CFO is focused on other priorities"
> "Understood - competing priorities are normal. What I'd suggest is quantifying the opportunity. If we can show €X million in freed capital and Y hours saved weekly, that tends to get attention. Would a quick ROI model based on your volumes be helpful?"

### "We need to maintain banking relationships"
> "Absolutely - those relationships have strategic value beyond payments. We complement banks, not replace them. Many customers use us for specific corridors or after-hours settlement while maintaining their core banking relationships."

## ROI Conversation Framework

### Quantifying the Opportunity

**Capital Efficiency:**
```
Current pre-funded balances: €___M
Current yield on those balances: ___%
Opportunity cost: €___M × (target yield - current yield) = €___/year
```

**Operational Efficiency:**
```
Hours spent on daily treasury operations: ___ hours
Treasury team hourly cost: €___
Annual operational cost: ___ × €___ × 250 = €___/year
Estimated reduction with RTGS: 40-60%
```

**FX Savings:**
```
Annual cross-border volume: €___M
Current FX cost (bps over mid): ___ bps
RTGS typical FX cost: 10-20 bps
Potential savings: €___M × (current - RTGS bps) = €___/year
```

### Questions to Uncover ROI

1. "What's your total pre-funded balance across all correspondent accounts?"
2. "How many FTEs touch treasury operations daily?"
3. "What's your annual cross-border volume by corridor?"
4. "What FX rates are you getting from your banks (spread over mid)?"
5. "How much do you buffer for unexpected flows?"
