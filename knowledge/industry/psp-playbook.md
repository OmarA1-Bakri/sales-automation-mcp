# PSP Industry Playbook

## Understanding PSP Prospects

### What is a PSP?
Payment Service Providers process payments on behalf of merchants and businesses. They sit between merchants and the banking system, handling payment acceptance, processing, and settlement.

### Key PSP Pain Points

1. **Liquidity Management**
   - Pre-funding requirements across multiple corridors
   - Capital tied up in correspondent accounts
   - Manual treasury management
   - Limited visibility into global positions

2. **Settlement Speed**
   - T+1 to T+3 settlement times
   - Customer complaints about delays
   - Competitive pressure from faster alternatives
   - Banking hours constraints

3. **Cost Pressures**
   - Correspondent banking fees eating margins
   - FX markups from intermediaries
   - Hidden fees reducing profitability
   - Pressure to reduce transaction costs

4. **Geographic Expansion**
   - Licensing requirements in each market
   - 12-24 month timelines for new licenses
   - High cost of regulatory compliance
   - Limited ability to follow merchants to new markets

5. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - ISO20022 migration requirements
   - AML/KYC obligations
   - Cross-border reporting requirements
   - Increasing regulatory scrutiny

## PSP-Specific Messaging

### Opening Hooks

**For Treasury Persona:**
> "Quick question: As you scale cross-border operations, how are you managing liquidity across multiple corridors without tying up excessive working capital?"

**For Payments Persona:**
> "Most PSPs we speak with are under pressure to offer real-time settlement while traditional correspondent banking still takes 1-3 days. How is {{company}} handling this?"

**For BD/Partnerships Persona:**
> "As {{company}} eyes expansion into {{region}}, how are you planning to navigate the licensing requirements and regulatory hurdles in each new market?"

**For CFO:**
> "Most payment operators we speak with see 2-4% of transaction value disappear in correspondent fees, SWIFT charges, and FX markups. Is this something {{company}} is looking to optimize?"

### Value Statements

**For Enterprise PSPs (>$500M volume):**
> "RTGS.global enables PSPs to eliminate pre-funded correspondent accounts while settling in seconds, not days. For a PSP processing your volume, this typically means $X million freed in working capital and 40-60% reduction in settlement costs."

**For Growth-Stage PSPs (<$500M volume):**
> "RTGS.global helps growing PSPs expand globally without the licensing delays and capital requirements of traditional correspondent banking. You can enter new markets in days, not months."

## Common PSP Objections

### "We're happy with our current setup"
> "Understood - if it's working, no reason to change everything. Where we typically add value is for specific corridors where speed or cost matter most, or for new markets you're entering. What corridors are most strategic for {{company}} right now?"

### "We've built our own correspondent relationships"
> "That's smart - direct relationships give you control. We complement that by adding corridors where you don't have direct relationships, or where you need faster settlement. It's not about replacing what works, but adding capability."

### "The integration seems like a lot of work"
> "Our API integration typically takes 2-3 weeks for basic functionality. Given the working capital you'd free up and the cost savings, most customers see ROI within the first quarter. Would it help to see a technical overview?"

### "We need to focus on other priorities"
> "Makes sense - timing matters. When do you think {{pain_point}} will become more urgent? Happy to share relevant case studies now so you have context when the timing is right."
