# Competitive Battle Cards

## SWIFT / Traditional Correspondent Banking

### Overview
SWIFT is the established global messaging standard for cross-border payments. Most PSPs and banks rely on correspondent banking networks that use SWIFT.

### When They Mention SWIFT

**Acknowledge:**
> "SWIFT is the established global standard - most payment operators rely on it, and for good reason."

**Differentiate:**

| Aspect | SWIFT/Correspondent | RTGS.global |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Settlement Time | T+1 to T+3 days | Seconds |
| Cost | Multiple intermediary fees | Direct, transparent |
| Transparency | Opaque routing | Full visibility |
| Operating Hours | Banking hours only | 24/7/365 |
| Pre-funding | Required | Not required |

**Key Differentiator:**
> "The main difference is we remove the intermediaries. SWIFT messages tell banks to move money through a chain of correspondents. We actually move the money directly, in seconds."

**Objection Responses:**

*"We're too integrated with SWIFT"*
> "Makes sense - most of our customers started the same way. They typically begin with one corridor as a pilot, see the results, then expand. No need to replace SWIFT entirely - this complements your existing setup."

*"SWIFT is reliable"*
> "Agreed - reliability is critical. Our uptime matches SWIFT at 99.99%, and for most corridors, we actually offer better visibility into payment status. The difference is speed and cost."

*"We've invested in SWIFT gpi"*
> "SWIFT gpi is a step forward in visibility. The difference is gpi still routes through correspondents with their fees and delays - it just gives you better tracking. We eliminate those intermediaries entirely."

**Switch Story:**
> "A Middle East payment operator was processing $50M/month through SWIFT. After switching to RTGS for their APAC corridor, they reduced settlement time from 2 days to 12 seconds and cut costs by 45%."

## Wise Business (formerly TransferWise)

### Overview
Wise is a consumer-focused fintech that has expanded to business payments. Known for transparent FX rates and lower fees than banks.

### When They Mention Wise

**Acknowledge:**
> "Wise has done a great job making FX transparent and accessible. They've changed expectations around pricing."

**Differentiate:**

| Aspect | Wise Business | RTGS.global |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Target Market | SMB, consumer-like | Enterprise PSPs, Fintechs |
| Settlement | Same-day (most) | Real-time (seconds) |
| API/Integration | Basic API | Enterprise-grade |
| Volume Handling | SMB volumes | High-volume processing |
| Customization | One-size-fits-all | Configurable per corridor |
| Licensing Support | N/A | Global network |

**Key Differentiator:**
> "Wise is great for SMBs who need simple, transparent transfers. For PSPs processing millions in volume, you need enterprise-grade infrastructure, real-time settlement, and the ability to offer this to your own customers."

**Objection Responses:**

*"Wise rates are really competitive"*
> "They are for retail volumes. At enterprise scale, our rates are typically more competitive, plus you get real-time settlement instead of same-day, and you can white-label the service for your customers."

*"We use Wise for some corridors"*
> "That's common - Wise works well for lower-volume corridors. Where we see customers switch is when they need real-time settlement, higher volumes, or want to offer cross-border as a service to their own customers."

## Ripple / XRP

### Overview
Ripple provides blockchain-based cross-border payment solutions. Uses XRP for liquidity in some corridors.

### When They Mention Ripple

**Acknowledge:**
> "Ripple has been innovative in applying blockchain to cross-border payments. They've raised the bar on what's possible."

**Differentiate:**

| Aspect | Ripple/XRP | RTGS.global |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Technology | Blockchain/crypto | Direct settlement network |
| Regulatory Status | Ongoing SEC issues | Regulated fiat rails |
| Adoption | Limited corridors | Growing global network |
| Crypto Exposure | XRP volatility risk | No crypto exposure |
| Integration | Complex | Straightforward API |

**Key Differentiator:**
> "Ripple's blockchain approach is innovative, but for treasury teams, the crypto exposure and regulatory uncertainty can be challenging. We achieve similar speed benefits using regulated fiat rails - no crypto volatility or regulatory gray areas."

**Objection Responses:**

*"Ripple is faster"*
> "Ripple can be fast in corridors where they have liquidity. The challenge is crypto volatility and regulatory uncertainty. We match their speed in our corridors without the crypto exposure - same speed, no volatility risk."

*"We're evaluating blockchain solutions"*
> "Makes sense to explore all options. What we hear from treasury teams is they want the speed benefits of blockchain without the operational complexity of managing crypto. That's exactly what we provide."

## Currencycloud

### Overview
Currencycloud provides B2B cross-border payment infrastructure, often used by fintechs and banks. Now owned by Visa.

### When They Mention Currencycloud

**Acknowledge:**
> "Currencycloud has solid infrastructure and the Visa backing adds stability. Good choice for basic cross-border needs."

**Differentiate:**

| Aspect | Currencycloud | RTGS.global |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Settlement Speed | T+1 typically | Real-time (seconds) |
| Pre-funding | Often required | Not required |
| Network Effect | Limited | Growing member network |
| Licensing Support | N/A | Global funds controllers |
| Treasury Tools | Basic | Advanced liquidity mgmt |

**Key Differentiator:**
> "Currencycloud is reliable for standard cross-border. Where we differ is settlement speed - we're seconds, not next-day - and our just-in-time funding means no pre-funding requirements."

**Objection Responses:**

*"We're already integrated with Currencycloud"*
> "No need to replace them for all corridors. Customers often use us for specific corridors where real-time settlement matters most, while keeping Currencycloud for others. It's about having the right tool for each use case."

## Banking Rails / Direct Bank Relationships

### Overview
Some PSPs build direct relationships with banks in each market rather than using a payment network.

### When They Mention Direct Bank Relationships

**Acknowledge:**
> "Direct bank relationships give you control and can work well for high-volume corridors. There's value in those partnerships."

**Differentiate:**

| Aspect | Direct Bank | RTGS.global |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Setup Time | 6-12 months per bank | Days per corridor |
| Maintenance | High (per relationship) | Low (single integration) |
| Coverage | Limited by relationships | Global network |
| Pricing | Negotiated per bank | Transparent, consistent |
| Treasury | Manage multiple positions | Unified management |

**Key Differentiator:**
> "Direct bank relationships work for a few high-volume corridors. The challenge is scale - each new market means a new banking relationship, new integration, new treasury position to manage. We give you one integration for global coverage."

**Objection Responses:**

*"We have good rates with our banks"*
> "That's great for those corridors. Where RTGS adds value is speed to new markets - you can launch a new corridor in days rather than months of bank negotiations. It complements your existing relationships."

*"We prefer direct relationships"*
> "Understood - control matters. Many customers use us specifically for markets where they don't have or don't want direct banking relationships, while keeping their bank partnerships for core corridors."
