          Hi {{first_name}},

          Glad this is timely! Based on your Q1 timeline and scaling needs,
          I'd suggest a quick 15-min call to ensure we're mapping to your
          specific requirements.

          {{calendly_link}}

          I can also send over pricing ahead of time if you prefer.

          Best,

          Hi {{first_name}},

          Competitor X is a solid choice - many of our customers used
          them before switching.

          The main reason they moved? {{key_differentiator}}.

          Here's a quick 2-min comparison showing how {{similar_company}}
          made the switch: {{comparison_link}}

          No pressure - just thought it might be relevant.

          Worth a look?

        body: |
          {{first_name}} - noticed you checked this out a few times.

          Worth a quick 10-min conversation?

          Yes: {{calendar_link}}
          Not now: {{snooze_3_months_link}}

          Either way is totally fine.
