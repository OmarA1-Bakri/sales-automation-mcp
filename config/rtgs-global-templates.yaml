    subject_variants:
      - "{{firstName}}, quick question about {{company}}'s treasury workflows"
      - "{{company}}'s liquidity management as you scale"
      - "{{firstName}}, optimizing working capital at {{company}}?"

    body: |
      Hi {{firstName}},

      I noticed {{company}} {{hook}} — congrats on the growth!

      Quick question: As you scale cross-border operations, how are you managing liquidity across multiple corridors without tying up excessive working capital?

      Most PSPs we work with face the same challenge — **inefficient treasury workflows that limit their ability to scale** while maintaining healthy cash positions.

      RTGS.global enables **just-in-time funding with instant settlement** (seconds, not days), which means:
      • No collateral tied up in correspondent accounts
      • Real-time visibility into global liquidity
      • 24/7 settlement capability

      {{caseStudy}}

      Worth a 15-minute conversation about your treasury operations?

  # Template 2: Cost Reduction Hook (High SWIFT/Correspondent Banking Fees)

    conditions:

    subject_variants:
      - "{{firstName}}, reducing {{company}}'s correspondent banking costs"
      - "SWIFT fees eating into {{company}}'s margins?"
      - "{{firstName}}, question about your cross-border payment costs"

    body: |
      Hi {{firstName}},

      Saw that {{company}} {{hook}}.

      Quick question: As you expand into {{newMarket}}, are SWIFT and correspondent banking fees becoming a significant cost center?

      Most payment operators we speak with see **2-4% of transaction value** disappear in correspondent fees, SWIFT charges, and FX markups.

      RTGS.global removes the intermediaries:
      • **Direct settlement** without correspondent banking chains
      • Access to the **most competitive FX rates** across our member network
      • Transparent pricing with no hidden fees

      {{caseStudy}}

      Open to exploring how this could improve your unit economics?

      - "{{company}}'s {{targetRegion}} expansion without licensing delays"
      - "{{firstName}}, quick question about {{company}}'s international strategy"

    body: |
      Hi {{firstName}},

      {{hook}}

      Quick question: As {{company}} eyes {{targetRegion}} expansion, how are you planning to navigate the **licensing requirements and regulatory hurdles** in each new market?

      Most PSPs we work with face a painful choice:
      1. Spend 12-24 months and significant capital getting licensed
      2. Compromise on target markets

      RTGS.global offers a third option: **Instant access to global currencies by partnering with our licensed funds controllers** in your target markets.

      • Enter new territories **overnight** vs years of regulatory work
      • Leverage local expertise in compliance and settlement
      • Focus your resources on customer acquisition, not licensing

      {{caseStudy}}

      Would love to show you how this works for {{targetRegion}}. 15 minutes next week?

    subject_variants:
      - "{{firstName}}, {{company}}'s settlement times vs competitors"
      - "Real-time settlement at {{company}}?"
      - "{{firstName}}, quick question about payment settlement"

    body: |
      Hi {{firstName}},

      I'm reaching out because most payment operators in {{region}} are facing pressure to offer **real-time settlement** while traditional correspondent banking still takes 1-3 days.

      Quick question: How is {{company}} handling customer expectations around **instant cross-border payments** while working within legacy settlement infrastructure?

      RTGS.global's platform enables **settlement in seconds, 24/7**:
      • Removal of intermediaries = no more settlement delays
      • Real-time settlement improves NPS and customer retention
      • No banking hours constraints (truly 24/7/365)

      {{caseStudy}}

      Worth exploring for {{company}}'s operations?

      - "{{firstName}}, question about {{company}}'s compliance strategy"

    body: |
      Hi {{firstName}},

      With the **ISO20022 migration** underway and regulators tightening AML/sanctions requirements, most PSPs are re-evaluating their payment infrastructure.

      Quick question: How is {{company}} ensuring your settlement infrastructure stays compliant with evolving standards while maintaining operational efficiency?

      RTGS.global is **built with compliance at its core**:
      • **ISO20022-aligned** from day one
      • Built-in transparency for AML and sanctions screening
      • Partner with licensed funds controllers for regulatory coverage

      {{caseStudy}}

      Many PSPs in {{region}} are facing similar challenges around {{painPoint}}, and we're seeing a shift toward **instant settlement infrastructure** to address this.

      - "{{firstName}}, is treasury optimization a priority?"
      - "Last note, {{firstName}}"

    body: |
      Hi {{firstName}},

      I've reached out a few times about optimizing {{company}}'s treasury operations and cross-border settlement infrastructure, but haven't heard back.

      I'm guessing it's either:
      1. **Not a priority** right now
      2. You're already working with a settlement network that meets your needs
      3. **Wrong timing** with other initiatives taking precedence

      If none of those apply and you'd like to see how RTGS.global could help {{company}} with {{painPoint}}, happy to chat.

      Otherwise, I'll close your file and wish you the best with your expansion.

      Best,
      {{senderName}}
